{-
in this sourcefile, a series of function working on monadic values are covered
-}

{-
we have a few tasks in this cource file:

1. implement the monadic type Writer, as understand what an inefficient list construction is
2. implement the difference list
3. implement the Reader type
4. [x] implement the stateful computation Monad (done in "./StateMonad.hs")
5. wrap error in Either
6. implement function liftM
7. implement function join
8. implement function filterM
9. implement foldM
10. make a safe RPN calculator
11. learn to compose monadic functions
12. learn how to make monads
